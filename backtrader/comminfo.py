class CommInfoBase(with_metaclass(MetaParams)):
    '''Base Class for the Commission Schemes.

    Params:

      - commission (def: 0.0): base commission value in percentage or monetary
        units

      - mult (def 1.0): multiplier applied to the asset for value/profit

      - margin (def: None): amount of monetary units needed to open/hold an
        operation. It only applies if the final ``_stocklike`` attribute in the
        class is set to False

      - commtype (def: None): Supported values are CommInfoBase.COMM_PERC
        (commission to be understood as %) and CommInfoBase.COMM_FIXED
        (commission to be understood as monetary units)

        The default value of ``None`` is a supported value to retain
        compatibility with the legacy ``CommissionInfo`` object. If
        ``commtype`` is set to None, then the following applies:

          - margin is None: Internal _commtype is set to COMM_PERC and
            _stocklike is set to True (Operating %-wise with Stocks)

          - margin is not None: _commtype set to COMM_FIXED and _stocklike set
            to False (Operating with fixed rount-trip commission with Futures)

        If this param is set to something else than None, then it will be
        passed to the internal ``_commtype`` attribute and the same will be
        done with the param ``stocklike`` and the internal attribute
        ``_stocklike``

      - stocklike (def: False):  Indicates if the instrument is Stock-like or
        Futures-like (see the ``commtype`` discussion above)

      - percabs (def: False): when ``commtype`` is set to COMM_PERC, whether
        the parameter ``commission`` has to be understood as XX% or 0.XX

        If this param is True: 0.XX
        If this param is False: XX%

    Attributes:

      - _stocklike: Final value to use for Stock-like/Futures-like behavior
      - _commtype: Final value to use for PERC vs FIXED commissions

      This two are used internally instead of the declared params to enable the
      compatibility check described above for the legacy ``CommissionInfo``
      object
