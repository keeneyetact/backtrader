Visual Chart
############

The integration with Visual Chart supports both:

  - *Live Data* feeding
  - *Live Trading*

*Visual Chart* is a complete trading solution:

  - Integrated Charting, data feed and brokering in a single platform

    For more information visit: www.visualchart.com

Requirements
************

  - *VisualChart 6*
  - *Windows* - the one VisualChart is running on

  - ``comtypes`` fork: https://github.com/mementum/comtypes

    Install it with: ``pip install
    https://github.com/mementum/comtypes/archive/master.zip``

    The *Visual Chart* API is based on *COM*.

    The current ``comtypes`` main branch doesn't support unpacking of
    ``VT_ARRAYS`` of ``VT_RECORD``. And this is used by *Visual Chart*

    `Pull Request #104 <https://github.com/enthought/comtypes/pull/104>`_ has
    been submitted but not yet integrated. As soon as it is integrated, the
    main branch can be used.

  - ``pytz`` (optional but really recommended)

    To make sure each and every data is returned in the market time.

    This is true for most markets but some are really an exception (``Global
    Indices`` being a good example)

    Time Management inside *Visual Chart* and its relation with the delivered
    times over *COM* is complex and having ``pytz`` tends to simplify things.

Sample Code
***********

The sources contain a full sample under:

  - ``samples/vctest/vctest.py``

The sample cannot cover every possible use case but it tries to provide broad
insight and should highlight that there is no real difference when it comes to
use the backtesting module or the live data module

One thing could be pin-pointed:

  - The sample waits for a ``data.LIVE`` data status notification before any
    trading activity takes place.

    This would probably is something to consider in any live strategy

VCStore - the store
*******************

The store is the keystone of the live data feed/trade support, providing a
layer of adaptation between the *COM* API and the needs of a data feed
and a broker proxy.

  - Providesaccess to getting a *broker* instance with the method:

    - ``VCStore.getbroker(*args, **kwargs)``

  - Provides access to getter *data* feed instances

    - ``VCStore.getedata(*args, **kwargs)``

      In this case many of the ``**kwargs`` are common to data feeds like
      ``dataname``, ``fromdate``, ``todate``, ``sessionstart``, ``sessionend``,
      ``timeframe``, ``compression``

      The data may provide other params. Check the reference below.

The ``VCStore`` will try to:

  - Automatically locate *VisualChart* in the system using the *Windows
    Registry*

    - If found, the installation directory will be scanned for the *COM* DLLs
      to create the *COM* *typelibs* and be able to instantiate the appropriate
      objects

    - If not found, then an attempt will be made with known and hardcoded
      *CLSIDs* to do the same.

.. note::

   Even if the DLLs can be found by scanning the filesystem, *Visual Chart*
   itself has to be running. backtrader won't start *Visual Chart*

Other responsibilities of the ``VCStore``:

  - Keeping general track of the connectivity status of *Visual Chart* to the
    server

VCData feeds
************

General
=======

The data feed offered by *Visual Chart* has some interesting properties:

  - **Resampling** is done by the platform

    Not in all cases: *Seconds* is not supported and has still to be done by
    *backtrader*

    As such and only when doing something with seconds would the end user need
    to do::

      vcstore = bt.stores.VCStore()
      vcstore.getdata(dataname='015ES', timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Ticks)
      cerebro.resampledata(data, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Seconds, compression=5)

    In all other cases it is enough with::

      vcstore = bt.stores.VCStore()
      data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='015ES', timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Minutes, compression=2)
      cerebro.addata(data)

The data will calculate a ``timeoffset`` internally by comparing the internal
equipment clock and the ``ticks`` delivered by the platform in order to
deliver the *automatically* resampled bars as early as possible if no new ticks
are coming in.

Instantiating the data:

  - Pass the symbol seen on the top-left side of *VisualChart* without
    spaces. For example:

    - *ES-Mini* is displayed as ``001 ES``. Instantiate it as::

	data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='001ES', ...)

    - *EuroStoxx 50* is displayed as ``015 ES``. Instantiate it as::

	data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='015ES', ...)

.. note:: *backtrader* will make an effor tna clear out a whitespace located at
	  the forth position

Time management
===============

The time management follow the general rules of *backtrader*

  - Give the time in *Market* time, to make sure the code is not dependent on
    DST transitions happening at different times and making local time not
    reliable for time comparisons.

This works for most markets in *Visual Chart* but some specific management is
done for some markets:

  - Datas in the exchange ``096`` which is named ``International Indices``.

    These are theoretically reported to be in the timezone ``Europe/London``
    but tests have revealed this seems to be partially true and some internal
    management is in place to cover for it.

The use of real *timezones* for time management can be enabled by passing the
parameter ``usetimezones=True``. This tries to use ``pytz`` if available. It is
not needed, as for most markets the internal time offsets provided by *Visual
Chart* allow for the seamless conversion to the market time.

In any case it would seem to be pointless to report the ``096.DJI`` in
``Europe/London`` time when it is actually located in ``US/Eastern``. As
such ``backtrader`` will report it in the later. In that case the use of
``pytz`` is more than recommended.

.. note:: The *Dow Jones Industrials* index (not the global version) is
	  located at ``099I-DJI``

.. note:: All this time management is pending a real test during a DST
	  transition in which local and remote markets happend to be out of
	  sync with regards to DST.

List of ``International Indices`` for which the output *timezone* is defined in
``VCDATA``::

        '096.FTSE': 'Europe/London',
        '096.FTEU3': 'Europe/London',
        '096.MIB30': 'Europe/Berlin',
        '096.SSMI': 'Europe/Berlin',
        '096.HSI': 'Asia/Hong_Kong',
        '096.BVSP': 'America/Sao_Paulo',
        '096.MERVAL': 'America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires',
        '096.DJI': 'US/Eastern',
        '096.IXIC': 'US/Eastern',
        '096.NDX': 'US/Eastern',

Small time problem
------------------

Passing ``fromdate`` or ``todate`` with a given **time of day** rather than the
default ``00:00:00`` seems to create a filter in the *COM* API and bars for any
days will only be delivered after the given time.

As such:

  - Please pass only **full dates** to ``VCData`` as in::

      data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='001ES',
                             fromdate=datetime(2016, 5, 15))

    And not::
      data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='001ES',
                             fromdate=datetime(2016, 5, 15, 8, 30))

Backfilling time lengths
------------------------

If no ``fromdate`` is specified by the end user, the platform will
automatically try to backfill and the carry on with live data. The backfilling
is timeframe dependent and is:

  - ``Ticks``, ``MicroSeconds``, ``Seconds``: **1 Day**

    The same for the 3 timeframes given that *Seconds* and *MicroSeconds* are
    not directly supported by *Visual Chart* and are done through resampling of
    *Ticks*

  - ``Minutes``: **2 Days**

  - ``Days``: **1 year**

  - ``Weeks``: **2 years**

  - ``Months``: **5 years**

  - ``Months``: **20 years**

The defined backfilling periods are multiplied by the requested
``compression``, that is: if the *timeframe* is ``Minutes`` and the
*compression** is 5 the final *backfilling period* will be: ``2 days * 5 -> 10
days``

Trading the data
================

*Visual Chart* offers **continuous futures**. No manual management is needed
and the future of your choice can be tracked without interruption. This is an
advantage and presents a small challenge:

  - ``ES-Mini`` is ``001ES``, but the actual trading asset (ex: Sep-2016) is
    ``ESU16``.

To overcome this and allow a strategy to track the *continuous future* and
trade on the *real asset* the following can be specified during data
instantiation::

  data = vcstore.getdata(dataname='001ES', tradename='ESU16')

Trades will happen on ``ESU16``, but the data feed will be frm ``001ES`` (the
data is the same 3 months long)

Other parameters
================

  - ``qcheck`` (default: ``0.5`` seconds) controls the frequency to wake up to talk
    to the internal resampler/replayer to avoid late delivery of bars.

    The following logic will be applied to used this parameter:

      - If internal *resampling/replaying* is detected, the value will be used
	as it is.

      - If no internal *resampling/replaying* is detected, the data feed will
	not wake up, because there is nothing to report to.

    The data feed will still wake up to check the *Visual Chart* built-in
    resampler, but this is automatically controlled.

Data Notifications
==================

The data feed will report the current status via one or more of the following
(check the *Cerebro* and *Strategy* reference)

  - ``Cerebro.notify_data`` (if overriden)n

  - A callback addded with ``Cerebro.adddatacb``

  - ``Strategy.notify_data`` (if overriden)

An example inside the *strategy*::

  class IBStrategy(bt.Strategy):

      def notify_data(self, data, status, *args, **kwargs):

          if status == data.LIVE:  # the data has switched to live data
	     # do something
	     pass

The following notifications will be sent following changes in the system:

  - ``CONNECTED``

    Sent on successful initial connection

  - ``DISCONNECTED``

    In this case retrieving the data is no longer possible and the data will
    indicate the system nothing can be done. Possible conditions:

      - Wrong contract specified
      - Interruption during historical download
      - Number of reconnection attempts to TWS exceeded

  - ``CONNBROKEN``

    Connectivity has been lost to either TWS or to the data farms. The data
    feed will try (via the store) to reconnect and backfill, when needed, and
    resume operations

  - ``NOTSUBSCRIBED``

    Contract and connection are ok, but the data cannot be retrieved due to
    lack of permissions.

    The data will indicate to the system that it cannot retrieve the data

  - ``DELAYED``

    Signaled to indicate that a *historical*/*backfilling* operation are in
    progress and the data being processed by the strategy is not real-time data

  - ``LIVE``

    Signaled to indicate that the data to be processed from this point onwards
    by the *strategy* is real-time data

Developers of *strategies* should consider which actions to undertake in cases
like when a disconnection takes place or when receiving **delayed** data.


VCBroker - Trading Live
***********************

Using the broker
================

To use the *VCBroker*, the standard broker simulation instance created by
*cerebro* has to be replaced.

Using the *Store* model (preferred)::

  import backtrader as bt

  cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
  vcstore = bt.stores.VCStore()
  cerebro.broker = vcstore.getbroker()  # or cerebro.setbroker(...)

Broker Parameters
=================

Be it directly or over ``getbroker`` the ``VCBroker`` broker supports no
parameters. This is because the broker is just a proxy to the a real
*Broker*. And what the real broker gives, shall not be taken away.

Restrictions
============

Position
--------

*Visual Chart* reports **open positions**. This could be used most of the time
to control the actual position, but a final event indicating a *Position* has
been closed is missing.

That makes it compulsory for *backtrader* to keep full accounting of the
*Position* and separate from any previous existing position in your account

Commission
----------

The *COM* trading interface doesn't report commissions. There is no chance for
*backtrader* to make and educated guess, unless:

  - The *broker* is instantiated with a *Commission* instance indicating which
    commissions do actually take place.

Trading with it
===============

Account
-------

*Visual Chart* supports several accounts at the same time in one broker. The
chosen account can be controlled with the parameter:

  - ``account`` (default: ``None``)

    VisualChart supports several accounts simultaneously on the broker. If
    the default ``None`` is in place the 1st account in the ComTrader
    ``Accounts`` collection will be used.

    If an account name is provided, the ``Accounts`` collection will be
    checked and used if present

Opperations
-----------

There is no change with regards to the standar usage. Just use the methods
available in the strategy (see the ``Strategy`` reference for a full
explanation)

  - ``buy``
  - ``sell``
  - ``close``
  - ``cancel``

Order objects returned
======================

  - Standard *backtrader* ``Order`` objects

Order Execution Types
=====================

*Visual Chart* supports the minimum order execution types needed by
*backtrader* and as such, anyhing which is backtested can go live.

As such the order execution types are limited to the ones available in the
*broker simulation*:

  - ``Order.Market``
  - ``Order.Close``
  - ``Order.Limit``
  - ``Order.Stop`` (when the *Stop* is triggered a *Market* order follows)
  - ``Order.StopLimit`` (when the *Stop* is triggered a *Limit* order follows)

Order Validity
==============

The same validity notion available during backtesting (with ``valid`` to
``buy`` and ``sell``) is available and with the same meaning. As such, the
``valid`` parameter is translated as follows for *IB Orders* for the following
values:

  - ``None`` translates to *Good Til Cancelled*

    Because no validity has been specified it is understood that the order must
    be valid until cancelled

  - ``datetime/date`` translates to *Good Til Date*

    .. note:: Beware: *Visual Chart* does only support "full dates" and the
	      *time* part is discarded.

  - ``timedelta(x)`` translates to *Good Til Date* (here ``timedelta(x) !=
    timedelta()``)

    .. note:: Beware: *Visual Chart* does only support **full dates** and the
	      *time* part is discarded.

    This is interpreted as a signal to have an order be valid from ``now`` +
    ``timedelta(x)``

  - ``timedelta() or 0`` translates to *Session*

    A value has been passed (instead of ``None``) but is *Null* and is
    interpreted as an order valid for the current *day* (session)


Notifications
=============

The standard ``Order`` status will be notified to a *strategy* over the method
``notify_order`` (if overridden)

  - ``Submitted`` - the order has been sent to TWS
  - ``Accepted`` - the order has been placed
  - ``Rejected`` - order placement failed or was cancelled by the system during
    its lifetime
  - ``Partial`` - a partial execution has taken place
  - ``Completed`` - the order has been fully executed
  - ``Canceled`` (or ``Cancelled``)

  - ``Expired`` - Not reported as of yet. An heuristic would be needed to
    distinguish this status from ``Cancelled``
