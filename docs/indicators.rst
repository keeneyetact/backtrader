Indicators
##########

The platform offers built in Indicators to aid in the development of
strategies. During development the list has been kept short to avoid having to
rewrite too many indicators with internal api changes.

The list below will be updated when new additions make it to the
platform. Please note that clearly "family" related indicators like Moving
Averages are listed under a group.
