Sizers - Smart Staking
######################

A *Strategy* offers methods to trade, namely: ``buy``, ``sell`` and
``close``. Let's see the signature of ``buy``::

    def buy(self, data=None,
            size=None, price=None, plimit=None,
            exectype=None, valid=None, tradeid=0, **kwargs):


Notice that ``size`` has a default value of ``None`` if the caller does not
specify it. This is where *Sizers* play an important role:

  - ``size=None`` requests that the *Strategy* asks its *Sizer* for the actual
    stake

This obviously implies that *Strategies* have a *Sizer*: Yes, indeed!. The
background machinery adds a default sizer to a *Strategy* if the user has not
added one. The default *Sizer* added to a *strategy* is ``SizerFix``. The
initial lines of the definition::

  class SizerFix(SizerBase):
      params = (('stake', 1),)

It is easy to guess that this *Sizer* simply *buys/sells* using a ``stake`` of
``1`` units (be it shares, contracts, ...)


Using *Sizers*
**************

From *Cerebro*
==============

*Sizers* can be added via *Cerebro* with 2 different methods:

  - ``addsizer(sizercls, *args, **kwargs)``

    Adds a *Sizer* that will be applied to any strategy added to
    *cerebro*. This is, so to to say, the default *Sizer*. Example::

      cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
      cerebro.addsizer(bt.sizers.SizerFix, stake=20)  # default sizer for strategies

  - ``addsizer_byidx(idx, sizercls, *args, **kwargs)``

    The *Sizer* will only be added to the *Strategy* referenced by ``idx``

    This ``idx`` can be gotten as return value from ``addstrategy``. As in::

      cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
      cerebro.addsizer(bt.sizers.SizerFix, stake=20)  # default sizer for strategies

      idx = cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy, myparam=myvalue)
      cerebro.addsizer_byidx(idx, bt.sizers.SizerFix, stake=5)

      cerebro.addstrategy(MyOtherStrategy)

    In this example:

      - A default *Sizer* has been added to the system. This one applies to all
	strategies which don't have a specific *Sizer* assigned

      - For *MyStrategy* and after collecting its insertion *idx*, a specific
	sizer (changing the ``stake`` param) is added

      - A 2nd strategy, *MyOtherStrategy*, is added to the system. No specific
	*Sizer* is added for it

      - This means that:

	- *MyStrategy* will finally have an internal specific *Sizer*

	- *MyOtherStrategy* will get the default sizer

      .. note:: *default* doesn't mean that that the strategies share a single
		*Sizer* instance. Each *strategy* receives a different instance
		of the *default* sizer

From *Strategy*
===============

The *Strategy* class offers an API: ``setsizer`` and ``getsizer`` (and a
*property* ``sizer``) to manage the *Sizer*. The signatures:

  - ``def setsizer(self, sizer)``: it takes an already instantiated *Sizer*

  - ``def getsizer(self)``: returns the current *Sizer* instance

  - ``sizer`` it is the property which can be directly *get/set*

In this scenario the *Sizer* can be for example:

  - Passed to the strategy as a parameter

  - Be set during ``__init__`` using the property ``sizer`` or ``setsizer`` as
    in::

      class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
          params = (('sizer', None),)

          def __init__(self):
	      if self.p.sizer is not None:
                  self.sizer = self.p.sizer

    This would for example allow to create a *Sizer* at the same level as the
    *cerebro* calls are happening and pass it as a parameter to all strategies
    that go in the system, which effectevily allows sharing a *Sizer*


*Sizer* Development
*******************

Doing it is easy:

  1. Subclass from ``backtrader.Sizer``

     This gives you access to ``self.broker`` although it shouldn't be needed
     in most cases. Things that can be accessed with the ``broker``

       - portfolio value through ``getvalue()``
       - value of the position of a given data with ``getvalue(data)``
       - *data* position through ``getposition(data)``

       Some of the other things are already below

  2. Override the method ``_getsizing(self, comminfo, cash, data, isbuy)``

     This method returns the desired ``size`` for the *buy/sell* operation

     The returned sign is not relevant, ie: if the operation is a *sell*
     operation (``isbuy`` will be ``False``) the method may return ``5`` or
     ``-5``. Only the absolute value will be used by the *sell* operation.

     ``Sizer`` has already gone to the ``broker`` and requested the
     *commission information* for the given *data*, the actual *cash* level and
     provides a direct reference to the *data* which is the target of the
     operation

Let's go for the definition of the ``FixedSize`` sizer::

  import backtrader as bt

  class FixedSize(bt.Sizer):
      params = (('stake', 1),)

      def _getsizing(self, comminfo, cash, data, isbuy):
          return self.params.stake

This is pretty simple in that the *Sizer* makes no calculations and the
parameters are just there.

But the mechanism should allow the construction of complex *sizing* (aka
*positioning*) systems to manage the stakes when entering/exiting the market.

Another example: **A position rerverser**::

  class FixedRerverser(bt.FixedSize):

      def _getsizing(self, comminfo, cash, data, isbuy):
          position = self.broker.getposition(data)
          size = self.p.stake * (1 + (position.size != 0))
          return size

This one builds on the existing ``FixedSize`` to inherit the ``params`` and
overrides ``_getsizing`` to:

  - Get the ``position`` of the *data* via the attribute ``broker``

  - Use ``position.size`` to decide if to double the fixed stake

  - Return the calculated value

This would remove the burden from the *Strategy* to decide if a position has to
be reversed or opened, the *Sizer* is in control and can at any time be
replaced without affecting the logic.

Practical *Sizer* Applicability
*******************************

Wihtout considering complex sizing algorithms, two different sizers can be
used to *turn a strategy from Long-Only to Long-Short*. Simply by changing the
*Sizer* in the *cerebro* execution, the strategy will change behavior. A very
simple ``close`` crosses ``SMA`` algorithm::

  class CloseSMA(bt.Strategy):
      params = (('period', 15),)

      def __init__(self):
          sma = bt.indicators.SMA(self.data, period=self.p.period)
          self.crossover = bt.indicators.CrossOver(self.data, sma)

      def next(self):
          if self.crossover > 0:
	      self.buy()

	  elif self.crossover < 0:
	      self.sell()

Notice how the strategy doesn't consider the current *position* (by looking at
``self.position``) to decide whether a *buy* or *sell* has to actually be
done. Only the *signal* from the ``CrossOver`` is considered. The *Sizers* will
be in charge of everything.

This sizer will take care of only returning a *non-zero* size when selling if a
position is already open::

  class LongOnly(bt.Sizer):
      params = (('stake', 1),)

      def _getsizing(self, comminfo, cash, data, isbuy):
  	if isbuy:
            return self.p.stake

  	# Sell situation
        position = self.broker.getposition(data)
  	if not position.size:
  	    return 0  # do not sell if nothing is open

  	return self.p.stake

Putting it all together (and assuming *backtrader* has already been imported
and a *data* has been added to the system)::

  ...
  cerebro.addstrategy(CloseSMA)
  cerebro.addsizer(LongOnly)
  ...
  cerebro.run()
  ...

The chart (from the sample included in the sources to test this).

.. thumbnail:: sizer-long-only.png

The *Long-Short* version simply changes the *Sizer* to be the ``FixedReverser``
shown above::

  ...
  cerebro.addstrategy(CloseSMA)
  cerebro.addsizer(FixedReverser)
  ...
  cerebro.run()
  ...

The output chart.

.. thumbnail:: sizer-fixedreverser.png

Notice the differences:

  - The number of *trades* has duplicated

  - The cash level never goes back to be the *value* because the strategy is
    *always* in the market

Both approaches are anyhow negative, but this is only an example.
